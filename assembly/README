This README is just a placeholder to remind me of how to interact with GDP and for other random tips that may be beneficial for me and/or anyone reading when stepping through code.

GDB Tips:
	CTRL + X, A     = open TUI (Text User Interface)
	step 			= step to next function
	stepi 			= step to next instruction
	i r {reg}		= view value in register e.g. i r eax
	break {fun} 	= set breakpoint at specified function
	run				= run program
	disassemble 	= show disassembled code for current function
